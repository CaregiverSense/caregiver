#
# Ð¢his Dockerfile allows you to build an image of latest version of the app which
# you can then run with the docker command.
#
# To build, use this command:
#
#     docker build -t cs-app https://github.com/CaregiverSense/caregiver.git
#
# There are a number of environment variables that are needed to run it.
# These variables will be provided in a file that can be saved as .cs.env, which
# you can then include at runtime as follows:
#
#     docker run --name memtag-app -p 7001:7000 $(cat ~/.cs.env) -d cs-app
#

# Pull base image.
