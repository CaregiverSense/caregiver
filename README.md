# Caregiver Sense

Using smartphones can be difficult for the elderly and challenged.
Actually, they can be difficult for just about everyone.

Caregiver Sense makes makes it easier for patients to:
 - Orient themselves in case they are lost
 - Quick dial people
 - Make reminders

Caregiver Sense also provides a platform for caregivers to:
 - view patient info
 - keep helpful notes about their patients that can be shared with other assigned caregivers.
 - configure the patient's mobile quick dial
 - configure the patient's mobile list of familiar places, for on demand navigation.
 - schedule the patient
 - contact the patient

Caregiver Sense can be launched from NFC wearable bracelets!
 - Emergency/medial personnel could scan the tag to access the patient's profile.
 - A self-scan of an NFC tag by the patient's phone brings up the app for them.
